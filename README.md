# Beatmap Manager

Client side beatmap manager of Bella Fiora.
The osu!lazer repo was forked for convenience.
The BellaFioraUtils and BeatmapManager projects under are independant of the osu Solution.

The BellaFioraUtils Project requires the osu.Game Nuget package, as well as these 4 .dll's:
- osu.Game.Rulesets.Catch
- osu.Game.Rulesets.Mania
- osu.Game.Rulesets.Osu
- osu.Game.Rulesets.Taiko

The BeatmapManager Project is a standalone HTTP client for BellaFioraUtils.
